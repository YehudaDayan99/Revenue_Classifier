As a result, significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company’s tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. The Company uses significant judgment in (1) determining whether a tax position’s technical merits are more likely than not to be sustained and (2) measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. As of December 31, 2024, the Company reported accrued liabilities of $6.5 billion for various tax contingencies. Auditing the recognition and measurement of the Company’s tax contingencies was challenging because the evaluation of whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex and involves significant auditor judgment. Management’s evaluation of tax positions is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings, and may be impacted by regulatory changes and judicial and examination activity."

We involved our international tax, transfer pricing, and research and development tax professionals in assessing the technical merits of certain of the Company’s tax positions.

We used our knowledge of and experience with international, transfer pricing, and other income tax laws of the relevant taxing jurisdictions to evaluate the Company’s accounting for its tax contingencies.
