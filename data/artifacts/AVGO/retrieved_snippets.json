FORM 10-K SUMMARY 97 SIGNATURES 98 1 Table of Contents PART I The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws and particularly in Item 1: “Business,” Item 1A: “Risk Factors,” Item 3: “Legal Proceedings” and Item 7: “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These statements are indicated by words or phrases such as “anticipate,” “expect,” “estimate,” “seek,” “plan,” “believe,” “could,” “intend,” “will,” and similar words or phrases. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. These forward-looking statements may include our projected financial results or expectations regarding acquisitions, developments in technology and products. Such statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections of our industry performance and macroeconomic conditions, based on management’s judgment, beliefs, current trends and market conditions, and involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. We derive many of our forward-looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts, which are based upon many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and it is impossible for u",

MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES None. 30 Table of Contents PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Market Information Broadcom common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “AVGO”. Holders As of November 28, 2025, there were 2,061 holders of record of our common stock. A substantially greater number of stockholders are “street name” or beneficial holders, whose shares are held of record by banks, brokers and other financial institutions. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities In April 2025, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to $10 billion of our common stock from time to time through December 31, 2025, which was extended to December 31, 2026 subsequent to fiscal year 2025. No shares were repurchased during the fiscal quarter ended November 2, 2025. As of November 2, 2025, $7,550 million of the authorized amount remained available for repurchases. Repurchases under this stock repurchase program may be effected through a variety of methods, including open market or privately negotiated purchases. The timing and amount of shares repurchased will depend on the stock price, business and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities, acquisition opportunities and other factors. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific amount of shares of common stock, and the stock repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time. 31 Table of Contents Stock Performance Graph The following graph shows a comparison of cumulative total return on our common stock, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index (the “S&P 500 Index”) and the NASDAQ 100 Index for the five fiscal years ended November 2, 2025. The total return graph and table assume that $100 was invested on October 30, 2020 (the last trading day of our fiscal year 2020) in each of Broadcom Inc. common stock, the S&P 500 Index and the NASDAQ 100 Index and assume that all dividends are reinvested. Indexes are calculated on a month-end basis. The comparisons in the graph below are based on historical data and are not indicative of, or intended to forecast, the possible future performance of our common stoc",
  "h-and-stock transaction (the “VMware Merger”). The VMware stockholders received approximately $30,788 million in cash and 544 million shares of Broadcom common stock with a fair value of $53,398 million. In addition, we assumed all outstanding VMware restricted stock unit (“RSU”) awards and performance stock unit awards held by continuing employees. The assumed awards were converted into RSU awards for shares of Broadcom common stock. All outstanding RSU awards held by non-employee directors and in-the-money VMware stock options were accelerated and converted into the right to receive cash and shares of Broadcom common stock, in equal parts. We funded the cash portion of the VMware Merger with the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2023 Term Loans, as defined and discussed in Note 10. “Borrowings” included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as cash on hand. We assumed $8,250 million of VMware’s outstanding senior unsecured notes. On July 1, 2024, we sold VMware’s end-user computing (“EUC”) business to KKR & Co. Inc. for cash consideration of $3.5 billion , after working capital adjustments. Acquisition of Seagate’s System-on-Chip Operations On April 23, 2024, we acquired certain assets related to the design, development, and manufacture of System-on-Chip operations of Seagate Technology Holdings plc for $600 million . Net Revenue A majority of our net revenue is derived from sales of a broad range of semiconductor and semiconductor-based solutions that are incorporated into electronic products, as well as from modules, switches and subsystems and, in some cases, racks. Net revenue is also generated from the sale of software solutions that enable our customers to plan, develop, deliver, automate, manage, and secure applications across mainframe, distributed, edge, mobile, and private and hybrid cloud platforms. Our overall net revenue, as well as the percentage of total net revenue generated by sales in our semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software segments, have varied from quarter to quarter, due largely to fluctuations in end-market demand which are discussed in detail in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Distributors and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), or their contract manufacturers, typically account for the substantial majority of our semiconductor sales. To serve customers around the world, we have strategically developed relationships with large global electronic component distributors, complemented by a number of regional distributors with customer relationships based on their respective product ranges. We have established strong relationships with leading OEM customers across multiple target markets. Our direct sales force focuses on supporting our large OEM customers and has specialized product and service knowledge that enables us to sell specific offerings at key levels throughout a customer’s organization. Certain customers require us to contract with them directly and with specified intermediaries, such as contract manufacturers. Many of our major customer relationships have been in place for many years and are often the result of years of collaborative product development. This has enabled us to build our extensive IP portfolio and develop critical expertise regarding our cu",
  "e reporting period. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual financial results may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies include revenue recognition, business combinations, valuation of goodwill and long-lived assets, and income taxes. See Note 2. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our critical accounting policies and estimates. Revenue recognition. We account for a contract with a customer when both parties have approved the contract and are committed to perform their respective obligations, each party’s rights can be identified, payment terms can be identified, the contract has commercial substance, and it is probable we will collect substantially all of the consideration we are entitled to. Revenue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of a promised product or service to a customer. Our products and services can be broadly categorized as sales of products and subscriptions and services. We recognize products revenue from sales to direct customers and distributors when control transfers to the customer. An allowance for distributor credits covering price adjustments is made based on our estimate of historical experience rates as well as considering economic conditions and contractual terms. To date, actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our historical estimates. However, because of the inherent nature of estimates, there is always a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates. Different judgments or estimates could result in variances that might be significant to reported operating results. We also record reductions of revenue for rebates in the same period that the related revenue is recorded. We accrue 100% of potential rebates at the time of sale. We reverse the accrual of unclaimed rebate amounts as specific rebate programs contractually end and when we believe unclaimed rebates are no longer subject to payment and will not be paid. Thus, the reversal of unclaimed rebates may have a positive impact on our net revenue and net income in subsequent periods. Business combinations. Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, restructuring liabilities, pre-acquisition contingencies, and contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired",
  "d other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes, interest, and penalties will be due. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the actual amount ultimately assessed, a further charge to tax expense would be required. If the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the accrued liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities no longer exist. 37 Table of Contents Fiscal Year Presentation We operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to October 31. Our fiscal year 2025 was a 52-week fiscal year. Fiscal year 2024 was a 53-week fiscal year and fiscal year 2023 was a 52-week fiscal year. The financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are presented in accordance with GAAP and expressed in U.S. dollars. 38 Table of Contents Results of Operations Fiscal Year 2025 Compared to Fiscal Year 2024 The following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented: Fiscal Year Ended November 2, 2025 November 3, 2024 November 2, 2025 November 3, 2024 (In millions) (As a percentage of net revenue) Statements of Operations Data: Net revenue: Products $ 44,847 $ 34,960 70 % 68 % Subscriptions and services 19,040 16,614 30 32 Total net revenue 63,887 51,574 100 100 Cost of revenue: Cost of products sold 12,115 9,805 19 19 Cost of subscriptions and services 2,371 2,983 4 6 Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets 6,031 6,023 9 12 Restructuring charges 76 254 — — Total cost of revenue 20,593 19,065 32 37 Gross margin 43,294 32,509 68 63 Research and development 10,977 9,310 17 18 Selling, general and administrative 4,211 4,959 7 10 Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets 2,031 3,244 3 6 Restructuring and other charges 591 1,533 1 3 Total operating expenses 17,810 19,046 28 37 Operating income $ 25,484 $ 13,463 40 % 26 % In fiscal year 2025, we included upfront license revenue of $7,800 million within products revenue. To conform to the current year presentation, we reclassified $4,601 million of upfront license revenue from subscriptions and services revenue to products revenue for fiscal year 2024. We also reclassified the related costs for the upfront license revenue, which were immaterial, for the periods presented. See Note 3. “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” in Part II, Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Net Revenue A relatively small number of customers account for a significant portion of our net revenue. Direct sales to one semiconductor solutions customer, which is a distributor, accounted for 32% and 28% of our net revenue for fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. We believe aggregate sales to our top five end customers, through all channels, accounted for approximately 40% of our net revenue for each of the fiscal years 2025 and 2024. We expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods. The loss of, or significant decrease in demand from, any of our top five end customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. From time to time, some of our key semiconductor custom",

We also reclassified the related costs for the upfront license revenue, which were immaterial, for the periods presented. See Note 3. “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” in Part II, Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Net Revenue A relatively small number of customers account for a significant portion of our net revenue. Direct sales to one semiconductor solutions customer, which is a distributor, accounted for 32% and 28% of our net revenue for fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. We believe aggregate sales to our top five end customers, through all channels, accounted for approximately 40% of our net revenue for each of the fiscal years 2025 and 2024. We expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods. The loss of, or significant decrease in demand from, any of our top five end customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. From time to time, some of our key semiconductor customers place large orders or delay orders, causing our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly. This is particularly true of our products used in AI and wireless applications as fluctuations may be magnified by the timing of customer deployments, as well as product launches. For infrastructure software, the transition to subscription licenses, as well as whether or not a customer has the right to terminate, causes variations in revenue recognized in each period. Although we recognize revenue for the majority of our products when title and control transfer in Penang, Malaysia, we disclose net revenue by country based primarily on the geographic shipment or delivery location specified by our distributors, OEMs, contract manufacturers, channel partners, or software customers. In fiscal years 2025 and 2024, 17% and 20%, respectively, of our net revenue came from shipments or deliveries to China (including Hong Kong). However, the end customers for either our products or for the end products into which our products are incorporated, are frequently located in countries other than China (including Hong Kong). As a result, we believe that a substantially smaller percentage of our net 39 Table of Contents revenue is ultimately dependent on sales of either our product or our customers’ product incorporating our product, to end customers located in China (including Hong Kong). The following tables set forth net revenue by segment for the periods presented: Fiscal Year Ended Net Revenue by Segment November 2, 2025 November 3, 2024 $ Change % Change (In millions, except percentages) Semiconductor solutions $ 36,858 $ 30,096 $",
  "e requirements will depend, in part, on our future cash flows, which are determined by our future operating performance and, therefore, subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. We expect capital expenditures to be higher in fiscal year 2026 as compared to fiscal year 2025. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flows from operations and our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to operate our business and fund our current obligations for at least the next 12 months. For additional information regarding our cash requirement from contractual obligations, indebtedness and lease obligations, see Note 14. “Commitments and Contingencies”, Note 10. “Borrowings” and Note 6. “Leases” in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. From time to time, we engage in discussions with third parties regarding potential acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, technologies and product lines. Any such transaction, or evaluation of potential transactions, could require significant use of our cash and cash equivalents, or require us to increase our borrowings to fund such transactions. If we do not have sufficient cash to fund our operations or finance growth opportunities, including acquisitions, or unanticipated capital expenditures, our business and financial condition could suffer. In such circumstances, we may seek to obtain new debt or equity financing. However, we cannot assure you that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. Our ability to service our outstanding indebtedness and any other indebtedness we may incur will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. We may also elect to issue additional debt or equity securities for reasons other than those specified above. From time to time, we manage our indebtedness through financings, redemptions, repayments, exchanges, tender offers, and other transactions. Such transactions will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, the terms of indentures, contractual restrictions and other factors. 42 Table of Contents Working Capital Working capital increased to $13,059 million at November 2, 2025 from $2,898 million at November 3, 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to the following: • Cash and cash equivalents increased to $16,178 million at November 2, 2025 from $9,348 million at November 3, 2024 primarily due to $27,537 million in net cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by $11,142 million of dividend payments, $3,860 million of employee withholding tax payments related to net settled equity awards, $2,812 million of net repayments of borrowings, and $2,450 million of common stock repurchases. • Trade accounts receivable, net increased to $7,145 million at November 2, 2025 from $4,416 million at November 3, 2024 primarily due to higher billings. • Other current assets increased to $5,980 million at November 2, 2025 from $4,071 million at November 3, 2024 primarily from higher software contract assets, offset in part by lower prepaid taxes and the sale of assets held for sale. These increases in working capital were offset in part by the following: • Short-term debt increased to $3,152",
  "s of November 2, 2025 and November 3, 2024, we had $67.1 billion and $56.3 billion in principal amount of fixed-rate borrowings outstanding, and the estimated aggregate fair value of these borrowings was $64.6 billion and $51.4 billion, respectively. As of November 2, 2025 and November 3, 2024, a hypothetical 50 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of our fixed-rate borrowings by approximately $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. However, this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on our borrowings outstanding. To hedge variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate of anticipated future debt issuances, we have entered, and in the future may enter, into treasury rate lock contracts. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 8.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of November 2, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of November 2, 2025 and November 3, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended November 2, 2025 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of November 2, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financ",
  "because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of November 2, 2025. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of November 2, 2025, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of November 2, 2025 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Part II, Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the fourth quarter ended November 2, 2025 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
