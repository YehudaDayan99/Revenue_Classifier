  "rationale": "This table disaggregates Alphabet's revenue by detailed business lines including 'Google Search & other', 'YouTube ads', 'Google Network', 'Google advertising', 'Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices', 'Google Services total', 'Google Cloud', 'Other Bets', and includes 'Hedging gains (losses)' and a 'Total revenues' row. It covers recent fiscal years 2023 and 2024, is from Item 8 / Notes section, and aligns well with the requested business lines (Google Services, Google Cloud, Other Bets) and keyword hints. It provides granular product/service line items rather than just segment totals, making it the best fit."
