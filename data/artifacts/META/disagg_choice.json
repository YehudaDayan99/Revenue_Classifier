  "rationale": "This table disaggregates revenue by product/service lines including Advertising, Other revenue, Family of Apps, Reality Labs, and has a Total revenue row. It covers recent fiscal years 2022-2024. Although inferred_dimension is unknown, the row labels correspond to product/service categories rather than segments or geography. It is more granular than segment-only tables and matches the preferred product/service dimension for revenue disaggregation."
