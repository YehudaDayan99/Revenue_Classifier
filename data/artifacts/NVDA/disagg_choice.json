  "rationale": "This table titled 'Revenue by End Market:' disaggregates revenue by business lines that closely match the requested segments: Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, Automotive, OEM and Other, and includes a 'Total revenue' row. It covers recent fiscal years including 2023, 2024, and 2025, is from Item 8 / Notes section, and shows granular product/service line items rather than just segment totals. It aligns well with the business lines provided and meets the preference for a detailed disaggregation of revenue by product categories rather than geography."
