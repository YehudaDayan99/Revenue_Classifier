Leases typically have a primary term ranging from one to 10 years, and a production period beyond the primary term that normally remains in effect until production ceases. Under certain circumstances, a lease may be held beyond its primary term even if production has not commenced. In some instances a “fee interest” is acquired in private property where the underlying mineral interests and rights are purchased and owned outright. Canada / Other Americas",

          "By 2050, the world’s population is projected to be around 9.7 billion people, or nearly 2 billion more than in 2023. Coincident with this population increase, the Outlook projects worldwide economic growth to average approximately 2.5 percent per year, with economic output nearly doubling by 2050 compared to 2023. As economies and populations grow, and as living standards improve for billions of people, the need for energy is expected to continue to rise. Even with significant efficiency gains, global energy demand is projected to rise by almost 15 percent from 2023 to 2050. This increase in energy demand is expected to be driven by developing countries (i.e., those that are not member nations of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)). By contrast, energy use in developed nations is expected to decline by more than 10 percent as efficiency improves. As expanding prosperity drives global energy demand higher, increasing use of energy-efficient technologies and practices as well as lower-emission products will continue to help significantly reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions per unit of economic output over time. Substantial efficiency gains are likely in all key aspects of the world’s economy through 2050, affecting energy requirements for power generation, transportation, industrial applications, and residential and commercial needs."

The effective tax rate, which is calculated based on consolidated company income taxes and ExxonMobil’s share of equity company income taxes, was 33 percent. This was flat compared to 2022, with higher effective rates from various jurisdictions offset by a lower impact from additional European taxes on the energy sector.
